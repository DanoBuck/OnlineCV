			<h2>Summary of Features</h2>
			<div style="text-align: left;">
				<p>
					This website consists of:
					<ul>
						<li>HTML5</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>HTML5</h3>
				<p>				
					The HTML5 is basic tags which allow for the structure of the website.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>
					The CSS has been modified to help the website to look the way it does. 
					This is used by changed default options provided through the Twitter bootstrap CDN.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Twitter Bootstrap</h3>
				<p>
					The Twitter Bootstrap is the bones of the CSS for this website. It provides a lot of class names which 
					I have plugged into my website to give it the bootstrap look and feel.
				</p>
				<h4>Features used of Twitter Bootstrap</h4>
				<p>
					I have used a lot of features in the Twitter Bootstrap collection. These include:
					<ul>
						<li>Navbar - for navigating around the website</li>
						<li>data-spy's - which link up to targets such as navbars and highlight different sections on the website</li>
						<li>Collapsible navbars - which take effect when the screen size decreases - it looks well on mobile and small devices</li>
						<li>Grids - allows me to break a screen into different sections by using Twitter Bootstrap grids</li>
						<li>Buttons - appealing button design</li>
						<li>Responsive images - allowing images to take different shapes on the website</li>
						<li>Modals - used for the contact form, work experience, and projects. Makes it interactive for the users as they choose what the went to see more of</li>
						<li>Typography - to make the text look nice</li>
						<li>Collapsible sections - the user can click buttons which makes something appear</li>
						<li>Pills/Tabs - which can be used to hide or see the selected information</li>
						<li>Tables - to show data in a neat readable format</li>
						<li>Footer</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</br>
				<h2>Dynamic Aspects</h2>
				<p>
					I have implemented some dynamic features to this website. These include using:
					<ul>
						<li>AngularJS</li>
						<li>JQuery</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li>Enformed</li>
						<li>Downloadable C.V.</li>
						<li>Football API</li>
						<li>Weather API</li>
						<li>System Clock</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>AngularJS</h3>
				<p>
					Angular is used in this site to populate a table in the education section. To do this I created a new JavaScript file and created a controller.
					In this controller I created a JSON array which I then inserted my college results into. When this was complete, I called this array in my
					website. Therefore, populating the table dynamically.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>JQuery</h3>
				<p>
					JQuery is used in this site to validate the contact form. This ensures that the user enters in a valid, in syntax, email address and 
					that a message and name are entered. A recaptcha is also used on the form to stop spam bots from spamming me. JQuery is also used for
					smooth scrolling with the tabs. A user can click on a tab in the navbar and they will be brought to the corresponding section
					via JQuery. Another nice interactive feature.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>
				<p>
					JavaScript is used to connect to the GoogleMaps API and display where I am located to the user.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Enformed</h3>
				<p>
					Enformed is a free service which allows you to send the data that has been entered in your form to your email address.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Downloadable C.V.</h3>
				<p>
					A link which allows the user to download and look at my latest C.V.
				</p>
				<h3>Football API</h3>
				<p>
					I have implemented a dynamic component to the website for Latest Liverpool F.C. fixtures i.e. their next match taking place.
					I used JavaScript and AJAX  calls to <a href="api.football-data.org"> api.football-data.org</a>. This took a bit of work to do 
					but was quite enjoyable manipulating the JSON response from the API. The script is located in the js folder in the root  of the
					structure. When the API is updated by the owner, the next football match for Liverpool, as I have implemented logic to work
					this out, will appear. I am very happy about how this works. I thought of this functionality as I constantly ask people who 
					Liverpool are playing. Now I will not need to. The date and time of the match has been formatted through my created functions.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Weather API</h3>
				<p>
					I have given the website the ability of displaying the current weather for Tallght, Dublin. This is done by making another JavaScript
					and AJAX call to a weather API which is located at <a href="https://api.forecast.io/forecast/">https://api.forecast.io/forecast/</a>.
					I send a GET request to this API to get the JSON response back from it. When I recieve a response I need to do more processing to it.
					The degrees I receive back is in Fahrenheit which most Irish people don't care about. This is not the response I wanted so I have
					implemented a function to convert this metric to Celcius. The date was also returned in the American format instead of the Irish
					format. I also wrote a function to format this the correct way.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h3>System Clock</h3>
				<p>
					Created a clock in JavScript which shows the user the time in real-time. When the website is open the clock will constantly be changing.
					This shows the user the time in real-time when they are on the website. The clock is located at the bottom of the screen in the current weather
					section.
